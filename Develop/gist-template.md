# FrankO-REGEX-Tutorial

I am creating a tutorial that specifically explains the email matching REGEX: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This will help me to become a better programmer and web developer so that I can search for things faster and more efficiently, which ultimately saves time and increases my productivity.



## Summary

I will be descriibing the email matching REGEX :  /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, component by component, letter by letter regardless of literal letter or meta letter.
