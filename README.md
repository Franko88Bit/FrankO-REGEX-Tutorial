# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex so that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines.


I am going to create a regex tutorial, that will include a descriptive title and introductory paragraph that will include a summary explaining the purpose of the tutorial.I will include a table contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does.I will also create a section about the author with a link to the authors github profile.The tutorial will also include links in the table of cotents that will take me to the corresponding sections of the tutorial.The tutorial will also include a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does.At the end of the tutorial you will find a section of the author and a link to the author's Github profile.
